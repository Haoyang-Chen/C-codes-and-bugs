# C-codes-and-bugs

it's just my first repository i opened when i was learning how to write bugs in C++ at first-year in collage.

if you accidentally came across this repository then you are very lucky to find my bugs 

and i am privillaged to have the chance to invite you (a stranger)to waste ur time on it
